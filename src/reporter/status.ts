/**
 * Progress: one message per Job, edited in place.
 *
 * A person delegates something long and walks away. When they glance back at the
 * Thread, **one** message tells them what the coworker is doing and how far through
 * it is — not a wall of narration to scroll past. So this owns a single message for
 * the life of a Job: posted before any work starts, rewritten as the plan advances,
 * and settled into a final line when the Job ends.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - **It never posts twice.** Individual tool calls are folded into the one message
 *   rather than announced. The other output channel — `./audit.ts`, a permanent record
 *   of every Write — has the opposite semantics on purpose.
 * - **It never fails a Job.** Progress is a courtesy and the answer is the work, so
 *   a Slack refusal here is warned about once and then endured.

/**
 * How often the status considers rewriting itself.
 *
 * Writing on every engine event would be simpler and wrong: `chat.update` is Tier 3
 * — 50+ per minute — and a Job revising its plan in a tight loop would spend that on
 * its own. Polling caps one Job at 12 writes a minute, and costs at most this long
 * before a plan change shows up.
 *
 * **The tier is per app per workspace, not per Job**, and Jobs in different Threads
 * run concurrently, so the instance-wide exposure is this cap times however many Jobs
 * are running. That number is bounded — `maxConcurrentJobs` defaults to four for this
 * reason, four times twelve being just inside Slack's fifty — but it is configurable,
 * so the arithmetic stops holding for an instance that raises it. In practice a Job's
 * plan changes every few tens of seconds rather than every five, so the steady state is
 * closer to the heartbeat alone; the pathological case is many Jobs all churning at
 * once, and {@link STATUS_BACKOFF_MS} is what makes that survivable rather than
 * prevented.

 * be the Reporter knowing about HTTP. A flat pause longer than Slack's own typical
 * retry window is the honest version: it stops the hammering without pretending to
