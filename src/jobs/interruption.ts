/**
 * Whether this Thread has a Turn in flight — written down, so that "in flight when
 * everything stopped" is still knowable afterwards.
 *
 * Durability is turn-granular. A completed Turn is durable and resumable; a Turn
 * interrupted partway **cannot** be resumed, and the engine keeps no trace of it — so
 * the next Job's honest reading of its own history is that the interrupted work never
 * began. It will happily push a branch that already exists.
 *
 * This is the fact that stops that, and it has to be on disk rather than in memory,
 * because the case that most needs it is the whole process dying. Set when a Turn
 * starts, cleared when one completes: anything that prevents the clearing — a bound, a
 * person typing stop, a crash, a failed Turn — leaves it set, which is exactly the set
 * of things that should warn the next Job.
 *
 * Shaped like the Reporter's two channels and the bounds: it watches the same event
 * stream and takes one thing from it. The difference is that its `observe` is awaited,
 * and deliberately — a flag that had not reached disk before the process died would be
 * a flag that fails in precisely the case it exists for.
