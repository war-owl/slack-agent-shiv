/**
 * What the instance checks before it accepts its first mention.
 *
 * The brief is one sentence: **a self-hoster starts the instance and either it runs or it
 * tells them exactly what is wrong.** Missing credentials, engine drift, and unreachable
 * MCP servers are found here with somebody watching rather than inside an unattended Job.
 *
 * Two severities, and the line between them is load-bearing:
 *
 * - **A report** describes an instance that will work. Version drift, the repository list,
 *   the bounds, the sandbox posture, a Root note full of prose. Some of these are warnings,
 *   which means "this will behave in a way you may not have intended".
 * - **A refusal** describes an instance that cannot deliver its configured capability or
 *   structural guarantees, such as an unreachable connector or writable Skills directory.
 *
 * Order matters only in one respect: the cheap local checks come before the network ones, so
 * a self-hoster with three things wrong does not have to wait on a connector round-trip to
 * learn about the first of them.
