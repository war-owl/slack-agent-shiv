     * **The command Codex had already launched outlives it**, reparented to init.
     * Measured, not assumed, and asserted as measured rather than as desirable: the
     * SDK kills the process it spawned, and that process is not a process-group
     * leader, so the `sleep 120` further down the tree keeps sleeping. Codex's own
     * direct child does die — it is the leaf that is orphaned.
     *
     * This is a real limit on what "stop" means, and it is the same limit the Job's
     * report already tells the human about: stopping unwinds nothing, and something in
     * flight may land anyway. What it does **not** leak is spend — the model is only
     * ever called by the process that just died — which is why the token budget is
     * still a bound on cost.
     *
     * **If this starts failing, that is good news:** upstream began killing the
     * process group, and this paragraph can go.
